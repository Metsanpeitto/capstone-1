## Getting Started

If you want to visit the Figma Design System that I created to help me building this project you can visit the following link

- [`https://www.figma.com/file/uxDIr6zq8lVsdJH08j6b0w/capstone-1`] (https://www.figma.com/file/uxDIr6zq8lVsdJH08j6b0w/capstone-1)

If you want to visit the deployed app just visit the following link:

- [`https://metsanpeitto.github.io/capstone-1/index.html`](https://metsanpeitto.github.io/capstone-1/index.html)

If you want a copy of this file go to the github repository and download it

- `git clone https://github.com/Metsanpeitto/capstone-1`

After cloning it you can see the project opening the index.html file with your favorite browser ( Firefox for example )

### Project requirements

- You need to implement a simple validation:

- You should personalize the content of your page. Choose a topic first and then design your webpage, keeping your topic in mind while you design it so that your page design works well for the topic you choose.
- You should build only these 2 pages:
  - The _home page_.
  - The _about page_.
- Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes:
  - Mobile: up to 768px wide.
  - Desktop: 768px or wider.
- You should follow these [design guidelines](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015), including:
  - Colors.
  - Typography: font face, size and weight.
  - Layout: composition and space between elements.
- Interactions
  - Links
    - The _home page_ should have a link in the menu to the _about page_.
    - The logo in the header links to the _home page_.
  - Mobile menu
    - When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
    - There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
    - The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.
- Dynamic page
  - The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
  - You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.

### Prerequisites

- Node.JS
